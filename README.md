# Force-Directed-Graph
C# Implementation of a Force Directed Graph, using Unity 2D.

Equations were based on this paper: https://cs.brown.edu/people/rtamassi/gdhandbook/chapters/force-directed.pdf

Uses Unity Rigidbody2D's to simulate a force directed graph.

It is an O(n^2) algorithm and therefore is only suitable for small n, where n is the number of nodes.
